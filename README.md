Here is my assessment submission for my application to Fetch

While the problem statement was rather simple, I took the time to establish a full architecture that is ready to scale further.

Included you will find that I used:
MVVM
Hilt / Dagger
Retrofit
Compose
Room Database

On the first run of the application, the list will be fetched automatically and cached locally.
On subsequent loads, the local cache is used allowing for offline use.
The list can manually be refetched from online using pull to refresh.

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission!
